Garfield kart™ is an unplayable mess.
I really expected more from a large brand such as Garfield™.
The multiplayer doesn't function properly and Garfield™ is just a mess of polygons gone wrong to a degree i did not realize was possible.
What a horrendous experience. I will NOT be reading Garfield™ comics anymore...
Thanks to the Steam™ support agent that refunds this. you are a hero, as I really needed that €1.24 back.
